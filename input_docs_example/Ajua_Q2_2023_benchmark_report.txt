A remarkable customer experience is critical to the sustained growth of any business. A positive customer experience promotes loyalty, helps businesses retain customers, and encourages brand advocacy.
Today, customers have the power, not the sellers. Who gave them this power? Us — with help from the world wide web. The present customer has a plethora of options to choose from at their fingertips, and the resources necessary to educate themselves and make purchases on their own.
This is why it’s so important to provide a remarkable customer experience and make them want to continue doing business with you — customers are the best resource for growing your brand awareness. It is therefore imperative that businesses measure their customer experience to determine what they are doing well and where there’s room for improvement!
The NPS( Net Promoter Score) is one metric that businesses need to use to measure and track customer loyalty to help them scale. Besides measuring customer loyalty, Bain and Company research shows that NPS scores predicted between 20% and 60% of revenue or market share trends, depending on the company.
NPS scores determine segmenting between poor and positive feedback. It measures customer perception based on one simple question: How likely are you to recommend [Organization X/Product Y/Service Z] to a friend or colleague?
Respondents give a rating between 0 (not at all likely) and 10 (extremely likely) and, depending on their response, customers fall into one of these three categories to establish an NPS score:
◊ Promoters respond with a score of 9 or 10 and are typically loyal and enthusiastic customers.
◊ Passives respond with a score of 7 or 8. They are satisfied with your service but not happy enough to be considered promoters.
◊ Detractors respond with a score of 0 to 6. These are unhappy customers who are unlikely to buy from you again, and may even discourage others from buying from you.
It’s simple to calculate your final NPS score – just subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.
For example, if 10% of respondents are Detractors, 20% are Passives and 70% are Promoters, your NPS score would be 70-10 = 60.
◊ Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.
◊ Passives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.
◊ Promoters (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and fuel growth by referring others.
Positive customer experience is essential for achieving customer satisfaction, word-of-mouth communications, loyalty, and competitive advantage across the globe.

Besides measuring customer loyalty, Bain and Company research shows that NPS scores predict between 20% and 60% of revenue or market share trends, depending on the company. Additionally, to
be able to measure the effectiveness of interactions between the business and its customers at each touch point requires a measure that is simple to use and communicate to a variety of stakeholders, ranging from frontline staff to company directors and shareholders. NPS provides both rigor and simplicity.
Additionally Net Promoter research by NICE Satmetrix, the co-developer of Net Promoter, shows that companies with scores higher than their competitors grow faster and are more successful.
Ajua, in addition to providing a platform for integrated customer experience and loyalty, provides tools to measure and track NPS at each customer touch point. Ajua also aims at providing industry and top brand Net Promoter Scores to help businesses make comparisons and set improvement goals.

Mobile Money Lenders
________________


Industry Overview
Q2 2023 saw changes in various aspects of the mobile money lenders platforms. It was characterized by changes in policies for lenders as well as increases in Central Bank Rates (CBR). Following the move by Google put and the new policy requiring digital lenders in Kenya to submit proof of license to operate in Kenya, the apps on the platform were not allowed to access users’ contacts, photographs, videos, call records, and location. This comes after complaints from users against the predatory lending apps. Therefore, only providers with licenses from the country’s pinnacle bank, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), will be listed on Play Store, Google’s digital distribution service. 


The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) raised the CBR rate from 8.75% to 9.5% resulting in lenders such as M-Shwari and other bank offered loans from banks such as NCBA, Family Bank, and Stanbic. This is the fourth time the CBK has raised the CBR within a year, and lenders have been quick to react whenever new rates are announced by raising borrowing costs for their borrowers.


MOBILE MONEY LENDERS INSIGHTS 
When asked about their willingness to use a loan product offered by the government, 79% of the respondents expressed their openness to considering such an option. On the other hand, 21% of the respondents stated that they would not consider using a government loan product. 


And we asked those who have used the Hustler Fund, and 81% (constant from Q1 2023) of those who said ‘Yes’ to taking a loan product from the government are using Hustler Fund. They appreciate the eligibility criteria, which allows any citizen above 18 years who has used the line for more than three months to qualify for the loan. Many borrowers find it convenient and helpful for covering their bills and expenses when they have limited funds. The low interest rates, respect for confidential data, and absence of harassment when requesting loan repayment are seen as advantages of the Hustler Fund. Users also commend its efficiency, availability, and the positive impact it has on their businesses. Some borrowers have expressed their desire for the principal amount to increase over time, as they believe it would better reflect their borrowing history and commitment. 


19% (constant from Q1 2023) are not. Those who didn’t did not because they don’t know the exact interest rates charged and found the initial loan amount to be too low. Others mentioned issues with the registration process, such as their ID number being registered by someone else or facing difficulties in borrowing due to ID misuse. There are also fears of potential harassment by the government for small loan amounts and dissatisfaction with the practice of withholding a portion of the borrowed money.
________________


Some individuals have experienced unauthorized use of their ID details for loan purposes. Complaints were also raised about the loan limit being insufficient and the short grace period provided for repayment. Some respondents mentioned being financially stable at the time of the loan product’s launch or not having a current need for it. Additionally, a few individuals tried to borrow but faced difficulties or were directed to try again later, and some already had existing loans from other mobile lenders. 
INDUSTRY LEADERS IN MOBILE MONEY LENDERS 
The overall NPS for the mobile money lenders for Q2 was 14, a drop from 23 in Q1 of 2022. 


Interest rates, data privacy, flexibility of repayment, loan limit, security, and legitimacy of the lender to avoid scams are the consideration requirements sought by borrowers before getting a loan. 


Hustler Fund: Which had an NPS 14, and it was the second most used lender by the respondents we engaged. Many borrowers were happy with low interest rates and convenient repayment periods. They also appreciated fast application responses, extensions for loan repayment, reliability, instant services, and accessibility. “Their rate of interest is so low. Though I didn’t give them a 10 as the loan should be repayable at least a month. Two weeks is so short.” “It helps when you are done on stock and makes your business run smoothly. When you pay, your limit increases.” “Very clear terms, enough payment period, and low interest.” “This lender provides affordable loan services and is the best and recognized by everyone.” “It’s processed fast and is available just by the providence of your National ID number and M-PESA PIN.”

}


M-Shwari had an NPS of 8, and the happy borrowers were happy with: fair interest rates and considerate repayment periods, reliability and promptness in providing assistance, and reasonable interest rates. Some, however, noted slightly high interest rates, and sample comments include: “The interest rate is fair, and the repayment period is considerable – 30 days to be precise.” “Low interest rate and 30 days of repayment.” “The more you do M-PESA services, the higher your limit grows.” “M-Shwari is reliable and always ready to help wherever you are in need of cash. They also give a maximum time before asking for payment.” “M-Shwari lends money on time, and their loan attracts an interest
________________
rate of 9.0% which is quite reasonable. Also, when you pay within ten days, they return 20% of the interest charged on the loan.” ”Mobile money lenders are good. They save you during a time when you don’t have money, and you have an emergency.” 
KCB-MPESA: Respondents were happy with flexible loan limits based on timely payments, favorable interest rates, a reasonable repayment period, and excellent customer service. Loan disbursement is immediate, and the interest rates are low compared to other lenders. It is possible to negotiate repayment plans. Sample comments include: “KCB-MPESA offers the best services, and the limit depends on payments. Their interest is favorable. The more you borrow and pay, the limit increases.” “Their rates are affordable, and they give a reasonable amount of time to pay back the loan.” “Reasonable interest, flexible payment period, and excellent customer understanding.” “You get their loan immediately and also the interest rate is low as compared to other lenders.” 
Tala had an NPS of 12, and respondents were satisfied with good service, reliability, and availability of services, lower repayment amounts for early payments, good loan limits and fast loan disbursement, affordable interest rates, and sufficient repayment time. Sample comments include: “Good service.” “Readily available and more effective.” “Their loan payment pending period is unique and gives a person time to pay slowly.” “They always help me much. I rank Tala ahead. The reason is, with Tala, the earlier I pay, the less I pay, unlike Branch, where the interest is fixed. On flexibility, Tala wins.” “Affordable interest rates, enough time to repay, a loan is given with no deduction.” “No delay when it comes to giving loans. Not too much interest rate and time duration is fine.” 
Other key players in the industry are Timiza, Branch, and Okash 
Contributors To Negative Customer Experiences in the Mobile Money Lenders Industry For Q2, many borrowers expressed dissatisfaction with various aspects of the service, including low loan limits, limited loan increase, short repayment periods, and high interest rates. Some borrowers also mention issues with customer service, privacy concerns, and difficulties in loan recovery. The negative experiences outweigh the positive ones, suggesting that there is room for improvement in the services provided by mobile money lenders. These negative experiences highlight the need for lenders to address issues such as loan limits, interest rates, repayment periods, and customer support to enhance customer satisfaction and trust in their services. Sample comments include: “Interest rate is very low. But the limit increase is almost non-existent.” “The loan does not increase in a steady way keeping in consideration the cost of living is so high.” “I don’t believe in mobile loans as a tool for growing business, but they are useful in case of emergency.” “Lends low amount, and also requires mandatory savings.” “Poor personal relationship. Poor credit recovery methods.” “Higher interest charged within a short period.” “Their interest rates are high (almost 10% per month). They need to reduce it to anywhere below 7%. The repayment period should also be increased to at least 90 days (3 months).” 
BORROWING HABITS 
Kenyans’ borrowing habits in Q2 were as follows: 26.7% of respondents borrowed more in Q2 2023. They borrowed more because of the intent to remedy financial challenges caused by inflation, high cost of living, and economic hardships. They mentioned that borrowing helps them meet basic needs, invest in business, and bridge financial gaps. Repaying loans on time often leads to increased borrowing limits.
________________


The borrowers highlight the tough economic conditions, increased expenses, and insufficient income as reasons for borrowing. They also mentioned the importance of timely repayments in order to access higher loan limits.


No change: 26.7%
Borrow less: 46%
Borrow more: 27.3%


The percentage of respondents who borrowed less in Q2 increased by four percentage points to 46% in Q2 2023. The borrowers reduced their borrowing habits due to the newfound understanding of the importance of living within their means and developing a disciplined approach to managing their finances, employment and felt that borrowing was unnecessary at the moment, credit limits were reduced or high interest rates, decrease in their credit limits due to payment delays, and alternative income sources and side hustles. 


26.7% of respondents did not change their borrowing habits. They maintained their habits because they borrowed only when necessary and when confident in their ability to repay the loan. Concerns about high interest rates and the desire to avoid increasing their debt burden influenced their borrowing decisions. They borrowed according to their current business status and financial needs, ensuring that they borrow an amount that aligns with their expenses


WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPACTFUL DETERMINANTS FOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AMONG MOBILE MONEY LENDERS? 
Interest rates continue to be the main factor driving borrowing from mobile money lenders, consistent with previous trends. Additionally, borrowers also consider factors such as loan terms and conditions, loan limits, payment periods, convenience, and accessibility when choosing these loans.

Industry Outlook


WHAT HAPPENED IN Q2, 2023? 
As noted in Q1 2023, the Tiktok trend of trying out restaurants in Kenya continues in popularity among the millennials as well as Gen Z. These restaurants, popularly known as ‘hidden gems,’ have arisen, and Kenyans are more interested in trying them out and sharing. The short video platform has provided a unique opportunity for people to showcase their culinary experiences to a wider audience. The food and beverage industry in Kenya showcases a diverse culture through food, and it has now become a norm for the youth to experience and share their dining experiences on the app. 


The trend has effectively prompted food establishments to up their game by improving their menus, services, and ambiance to cater to the contemporary dining experience. As Kenyans embrace the digital era, restaurateurs have now joined the TikTok trend and are showcasing their culinary dexterity to this online audience. This new marketing strategy has provided a unique opportunity for restaurants and the entire food industry in Kenya. 


In Kenya, Tiktokers have been sharing their experiences trying out restaurants in creative ways. They showcase their choice of restaurant, the ambiance, the menu, and the food. 


TikTokers such as @Indianting123 and @foodstakenya have been doing the trending challenge of visiting popular Nairobi restaurants and trying out their different dishes. Their videos are fun and relatable and have gained a large following. There are others also sharing their restaurant experiences in a unique way. Some may focus on the aesthetics of the restaurant: the interior decor, the lighting, and the presentation of food, all while sampling dishes from different restaurants around town. 


TikTok has therefore provided a platform for restaurants to showcase their dishes and also attract a large following who turn into customers, thus increasing their revenue.
